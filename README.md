We are developing a platform for medical diagnostic centres that is similar to Zomato. This platform would allow users to search and compare different diagnosis centres based on various criteria such as location, services offered, ratings, and reviews from other patients. Users would be able to view detailed information about each centre, including the available equipment and technologies, staff qualifications, and the prices for various tests and procedures.By providing a centralised platform for finding and comparing diagnosis centres, our project aims to make it easier for patients to find the right centre for their needs and to make informed decisions about their healthcare. Furthermore, this platform could include appointment booking and payment processing features to make the process of visiting a diagnosis more convenient.
